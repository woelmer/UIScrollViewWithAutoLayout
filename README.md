# UIScrollViewWithAutoLayout

This is a fork of [Mike Woelmer's project].

- This project demonstrates how to setup a UIScrollView with Auto Layout.
- It stretches the content of the scroll view in portrait and landscape.
- Demonstrates how you can use the UIScrollView to move content out of the way of the keyboard.

I've extended it a little bit so that code that adds constraints in view controller is replaced with extra constraint in Storyboard. Here is the [post with explanation].
